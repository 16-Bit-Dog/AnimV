# AnimV
This is a project with the goal of analysing an image mathimatically for allowing free modifications of video content
... its not the best - nor worst working project out there... 
 
To Use Steps:
1. click `Open MP4` and choose .mp4 file
2. click `Open FFMPEG` to choose ffmpeg.exe
3. choose `Directory For Video Frame Output` to set directory of all output
4. click `Split Video Into Seperate Frames` <-- done for every new video loaded to split video into seperate frames
5. Click `Set Paths To Cache` to store all of the open'ed files for later use
6. check true `Save Video Images`
7. `Cache Video Images` takes lots of RAM but greatly speeds up code
8. choose Compute output to show --> num 0 and 1 are pixel frequency and rate of change
9. block_size is generally a bad idea to play around with
10. Sample count is amount of data forward and back to sample from (slower but accurate)
11. check num 0 and num 1 --> Compute accurate is slow but good for data accuracy of output 
12.  `run compute pass`
13.  choose FPS's of current and post --> use `soft body` frame interpolation for accurate attempt at interpolating
